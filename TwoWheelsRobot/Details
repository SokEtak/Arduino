Description:
This Arduino code is designed to control a small autonomous robot equipped with DC motors, 
IR sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor. It uses the Adafruit Motor Shield to control motor movement and relies 
on sensor input for basic navigation.

Components:

Arduino Board - 1
Adafruit Motor Shield - 1
DC Motors - 2 (connected to motor ports 3 and 4)
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) - 1/2
IR Sensors (analog) - 4 (connected to A0 - A4)
Jumper Wires - several (for connecting components)
Power Supply (e.g., battery pack) - 1 (to power the motors and Arduino)
