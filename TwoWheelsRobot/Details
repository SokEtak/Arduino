Description:
This Arduino code is designed to control a small autonomous robot equipped with DC motors, 
IR sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor. It uses the Adafruit Motor Shield to control motor movement and relies 
on sensor input for basic navigation.

Components Needed:
- Arduino Board - 1
- Adafruit Motor Shield - 1
- DC Motors - 2 (connected to motor ports 1 and 3)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) - 1
- IR Sensors (analog) - 2 (connected to A0 and A1)
- Jumper Wires - several (for connecting components)
- Power Supply (e.g., battery pack) - 1 (to power the motors and Arduino)

How to Install the Adafruit Motor Shield Library

Option 1: Install via Arduino IDE Library Manager
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Click Sketch, then Include Library, then Manage Libraries.
- In the search box, type "Adafruit Motor Shield".
- Look for "Adafruit Motor Shield library" by Adafruit.
- Click Install.
- Make sure it is for the AFMotor class (the older Adafruit Motor Shield V1).

Option 2: Install manually
- Download the library from GitHub: Adafruit Motor Shield V1 Library.
- Unzip the downloaded file.
- Copy the unzipped folder into your Arduino/libraries/ folder.
- Restart the Arduino IDE.
