Description:
This Arduino program reads data from an analog sensor and displays the result on an I2C LCD screen. Based on the sensor's value, it classifies the 
input into different categories (such as colors) and shows the corresponding label on the LCD. It also prints the raw sensor data to the Serial Monitor for 
monitoring or debugging. The code includes functionality for measuring distance using an ultrasonic sensor, though it is not currently active in the main program.


How to install:
You need to install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library to work with the LCD. You can install it using the Arduino Library Manager:

Steps to Install:
Open Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.

In the search bar, type LiquidCrystal_I2C.

Look for LiquidCrystal I2C by Frank de Brabander.

Click Install.
